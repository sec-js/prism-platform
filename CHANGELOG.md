## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Graceful degradation for key-dependent modules** — a standard status enum (`ok` / `skipped` / `rate_limited` / `error`) in `modules/module_status.py`; Shodan, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Censys, Leak-Lookup/HIBP and Telegram now report `skipped` when an API key is absent and `rate_limited` on HTTP 429 instead of failing, with per-module status badges in the dashboard (#61).
- **`HIBP_API_KEY` config option** — the HIBP breach lookup reads a real key and skips up-front when it is absent, instead of always hitting an unauthenticated 401 (#61).
- **One-command demo** — `docker compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up` boots PRISM with preloaded sample scans, no API keys required (#63).
- **IP / Subnet calculator** standalone tool (#45).
- **Hash Identifier** standalone tool — detects MD5 / SHA-1 / SHA-256 / SHA-512 from length and charset (#76).
- **Per-module refresh** — a refresh button on each result card re-runs just that module and updates its result (#104).
- **Approximate region-level GeoIP map for phone scans** — geocodes the operator region and highlights the area (clearly labelled "approximate") instead of leaving the map blank.
- **Bundled Unicode fonts (DejaVu Sans/Mono)** for PDF reports.
- **Project polish** — README API reference + environment-variables table, FAQ, Table of Contents, `LICENSE` (MIT), `CITATION.cff`, `SUPPORT.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.dockerignore`, Sponsor/funding config, and Bug/Feature issue forms.

### Changed
- **Scan history** is now sorted by date (newest first), auto-refreshes after a scan completes, and its labels are localized in all five languages.
- The scan engine caches only genuinely successful (`ok`) results, so a missing key is not frozen in cache once configured (#61).
- The Censys tab is hidden when the module is skipped (no API key) instead of showing an empty card.
- Removed the default Leaflet attribution flag from all maps.

### Fixed
- **PDF reports rendered non-Latin text (e.g. Cyrillic) as empty grey boxes** — bundled DejaVu fonts now render Unicode correctly.
- **GeoIP map sometimes rendered blank** — the map recalculates its size after the layout settles.
- **New scans could be missing from history** — the list was capped before sorting; it now sorts by date, then caps.
- **Sidebar "Modules" label showed the raw i18n key** (duplicate `sidebar.modules`) — fixed and localized.
- **Empty numeric env vars crashed startup** — `CACHE_TTL_HOURS`, `MAX_STORED_SCANS` and `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` fall back to their defaults when set to an empty value (#122).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Scan history** — collapsible History panel in sidebar fetches past scans from `/api/scans` and loads results on click (#38).
- **Scan comparison mode** — select two scans from history and view a side-by-side diff table with added/removed/changed fields (#58).
- **CSV export** — flattened Module/Key/Value CSV download with BOM for Excel compatibility (#43).
- **Markdown export** — structured `.md` report with OPSEC score, WHOIS, DNS, subdomains, and accounts (#55).
- **French (FR) locale** — full UI translation including new toolPanels, tips, scanTypes, and module labels (#14).
- **Spanish (ES) locale** — full UI translation with the same coverage (#28).
- **Standalone CLI** — `python cli.py scan <target>` with `--json`, `--html`, `--pdf` output, module selection, and auto-type detection (#39).
- **Slack/Discord webhook formatters** — `WEBHOOK_FORMAT=slack|discord` env var transforms payloads to Block Kit or embed format (#35).
- **Rate-limit response headers** — `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` via slowapi built-in handler (#37).
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — ArrowLeft/ArrowRight cycles result tabs, skips inputs (#33).
- **Copy all emails** — aggregates emails from WHOIS, emailrep, breaches, and scan target into one-click copy (#34).
- **Scan duration** — displays elapsed time in results header (#29).
- **Username filter** — search input in accounts tab to filter platforms (#44).
- **Loading skeleton** — pulse-animated placeholder shown during scan progress (#54).
- **ESLint config** — `next/core-web-vitals` ruleset for frontend (#36).
- **GitHub PR template** — standardized pull request description format (#48).
- **Minor fixes**.

### Changed
- Sidebar refactored to use i18n module labels (`sidebar.modules.<id>`) and localized scan type buttons.
- `_rate_limit_exceeded_handler` replaces inline lambda for proper 429 response headers.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- Multilingual report translation layer via `modules/report_i18n.py` for ENG/RUS/DET report rendering.
- New map i18n keys for precision metadata (`precision`, `approximate`) across ENG/RUS/DET locales.

### Changed
- Frontend map rendering switched from single-marker OSM iframe to Leaflet multi-marker rendering in `ScanResults`.
- Frontend version labels updated to `v2.2.0` in topbar and loading screen.
- Backend and frontend application versions bumped to `2.2.0`.

### Fixed
- `#27` map view now renders all discovered locations instead of only the first marker.
- `#26` Wayback sensitive URL findings are included in dashboard flow (`wayback.interesting`) and displayed in results.
- `#25` phone map no longer fabricates coordinates from region/country guesses; marker is shown only for explicit coordinates.
- `#21` API key is no longer accepted via query string and permissive wildcard CORS default is removed.
- `#20` auth bypass with missing API keys is removed by default; anonymous mode requires explicit `ALLOW_ANON_API=true`.
- Comment/docstring cleanup completed across source files with build-safe manual TSX repairs.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-18

### Added
- **Webhook callback support** — pass an optional `webhook_url` in
  `POST /api/scan`; a `POST` is delivered to that URL when the scan
  reaches a terminal state. Signed with `X-Prism-Secret` when
  `WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set. Private/loopback hosts are rejected.
  Docs: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (issue #18).
- **OPSEC category tooltips** — hover over a category in the score bar
  to see a one-line explanation of what it measures (issue #17).
- **Alt+T keyboard shortcut** to toggle dark/light theme. Topbar
  tooltip updated with the hint (issue #15).
- **German (DE) locale** — full UI translation; language switcher now
  cycles EN → RU → DE and auto-detects from `navigator.language`
  (issue #12).
- AI summary copy button refactored to share the global
  `copyValue` + toast mechanism (PR #19 follow-up).

### Changed
- **PDF export** switched from WeasyPrint (52.5, broken on Windows
  without GTK) to **xhtml2pdf** (pure-Python). A dedicated
  PDF-friendly template is used so output is stable across OSes.

### Fixed
- PDF export endpoint no longer returns `501` / install errors on
  Windows. Generated PDFs render OPSEC score, findings, WHOIS, DNS,
  GeoIP, subdomains, threat intel and phone data correctly.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Module-level scan progress bar** — real-time `5/8 modules · 62%`
  visual indicator with per-module status chips (issue #9).
- **PDF report export** — `GET /api/scan/{id}/report/pdf` renders the
  HTML report with WeasyPrint. Frontend "PDF Report" button (issue #8).
- **Censys integration** — host services + certificate-based subdomain
  discovery via Censys Search API v2 (issue #3).
- **Dark-web `.onion` mirror checker** — aggregates Ahmia + DarkSearch
  for any domain or organization name (issue #2).
- **i18n / multi-language UI** — English & Russian out of the box,
  language switcher in the topbar, auto-detection from
  `navigator.language` (issue #1).
- **One-click copy buttons** across scan results
  (target, IP, emails, DNS records, subdomains, account URLs, ports).
- **Architecture documentation** — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Roadmap & Star History** sections in README.

### Changed
- README rewritten for v2.1: refreshed badges, module table, key list,
  features list, roadmap section.
- "Print PDF" button now downloads a server-rendered PDF instead of
  invoking the browser print dialog.
- 22+ modules, 14 of which work with **zero API keys**.

### Fixed
- Merge conflict in `ScanResults.tsx` header that broke the build on
  certain mirror checkouts.
- Module progress in `ScanProgress` no longer relies on log parsing.
